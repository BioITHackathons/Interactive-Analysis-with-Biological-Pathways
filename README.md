# Interactive-Analysis-with-Biological-Pathways
The Autopath project explores biological pathways for autoimmune diseases. Our case study is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) which is a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues and organs, leading to inflammation and damage. 

# Project Objectives - What's the problem?   
How can we leverage existing data to understand and treat disease? 

## Challenges 
- Too much data; too hard to find the right data
- Analysis tools not user-friendly (for biologists); require too much comp bio wrangling

## The Solution
- Create a workflow to transform single cell expression data to a visualization of gene pathway enrichment
- Access data where it lives - possibly different “places” -  and analyze collaboratively where it’s most efficient - possibly two different clouds (AWS and GCP).

# Workflow

- **Docker**:
Make sure Docker is installed and actively running in the background.
Verify Docker installation and status using:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```
